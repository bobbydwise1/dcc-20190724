# Daily Coding Problem 2019-07-24

####  _ Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today._

_This problem was asked by Amazon._

_There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters._

_For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:_

* _1, 1, 1, 1_
* _2, 1, 1_
* _1, 2, 1_
* _1, 1, 2_
* _2, 2_

_What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time._
